# Alternative Learning Co-op of Minnesota

This is the GitHub repository of the Alternative Learning Co-op of MN, or ALCMN, for short.

The co-op is an informal group of families and educators, roughly located near Minneapolis, Minnesota. We are organizing to provide support for homeschooling our students in the 2020-2021 school year.
